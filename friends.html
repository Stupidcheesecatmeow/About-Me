    <div>
        <p class="hidden">I met Bejay when I was 15. We met in discord, our personalities instantly clicked, we hung out everyday to play various games up to staying out late to talk about so many things. Bejay is the epitome of comfort, she’s warm, thoughtful, considerate, funny, a one call away. She became one of the most important people in my life in an instant, my pillar, my solace, my other half. She may not be perfect but she makes sure to always improve herself everyday, we watch each other grow into a better person. Whenever there’s a problem around I can count on her and vice versa.</p>
        <p class="hidden">Even now that we’re busy with our own lives, we don’t miss checking on each other although it's not as often as before we still make time for each other to catch up. I consider Bejay as my sister, we even have a nickname for each other—UK short for unofficial kapatid. Sometimes Bejay also acts like my mother. She always reminds me to take my meds, don’t stay up too late, and gives me love advice. Aside from that she also scolds me when I do something wrong but protects me when I’ve been wronged by someone and cheers me up when I’m upset.</p>
        <p class="hidden">Everybody deserves to have someone like Bejay. To have a best friend, a mother, and a sister in all one person. And I hope Bejay finds a lover too so she would stop nagging me to have one and also to stop other people into thinking that we’re lovers. She deserves it more than me, she’s been nothing but a great friend to everyone. Bejay deserves to be taken care of as much as she takes care of everyone. I love you, my UK.</p>

    <h2>Jamie</h2>

        <img src="c:\Users\Jebi\Downloads\Jamjam.jpg" alt="Jamjam"/>
      <br>

   <div>
       <p class="hidden">Jamie and I met back in senior high school, and we’ve been inseparable ever since. Even though she’s now at a different university, we still make time for each other. She is one of the kindest and funniest people I know, always ready to share a laugh or lend a listening ear. One of the best parts about our friendship is how she loves to tease me about being small and my "weak knees"—which, let’s be real, might be a little true, But it’s all in good fun and just makes our hangouts even more entertaining.</p>
       <p class="hidden">We have so much in common, from our love for the same music to our shared interests in movies and snacks. It’s crazy how we can talk for hours and never run out of things to say. We often spend weekends hanging out at her house, where I feel right at home. Honestly, I’ve practically adopted her parents as my own, and they always treat me like family too. It’s so nice to have that kind of warmth and support in my life.</p>
       <p class="hidden">Even though we may not see each other as often as we’d like, our friendship is still super strong. Jamie’s always there to make me laugh and remind me that it’s okay to be emotional sometimes—after all, being a crybaby is what makes us human. I’m truly grateful for having someone like her in my life, and I can’t wait to see what memories we’ll create together in the future.</p>

       <img src="c:\Users\Jebi\Downloads\junas.jpg" alt="Junas"/>
      <br>
    <div>
        <p class="hidden">Jonas and I also met in senior high school—him, Jamie, and me are a trio. Whenever we hang out, we always take what we call our "family pictures," which totally capture the fun moments we share. Jonas might be a bit shy sometimes, but he has a heart of gold, and his kindness really shines through in everything he does.</p>
        <p class="hidden">One of the coolest things about Jonas is his dancing skills. He’s part of the Peninsulares Dance Company, and it’s amazing to see him in action. Even though he can be a little reserved, when he dances, it’s like he transforms into this whole different person, full of confidence and energy. It’s been great to share interests with him too, like our love for coloring our hair. We’ve had some fun color experiments over the years.</p>
        <p class="hidden">Back in senior high school, we often went on rides together, exploring new places and just enjoying each other's company. Those adventures created so many awesome memories that I’ll cherish forever. I’m really lucky to have Jonas as a friend, along with Jamie; together, we make a great team, and I can’t wait to see what else our friendship has in store.</p>

It’s like she has this superpower for making tough subjects seem a lot easier. Whenever we’re studying together, she explains things so well that it clicks for me. I really admire how she can juggle everything—school, activities, and still have time to hang out with us.</p>
        <p class="hidden">Apart from being a brainiac, Abby is hilarious! She has the best sense of humor and always knows how to crack a joke or tell a funny story that has us all laughing. Even when things get stressful, she manages to lighten the mood, and I appreciate that so much. It makes studying and hanging out way more fun. She really knows how to strike the perfect balance between being serious when it counts and just having a good time with friends.</p>
        <p class="hidden">What makes Abby even more amazing is how caring she is. She has this awesome ability to tell when someone’s feeling down and is always there to cheer us up. It’s like she has a sixth sense! Abby often plays the "mom" role in our group, always looking out for everyone and making sure we’re okay. She's really brave too, standing up for her friends and what she believes in. We’re so lucky to have her in our lives; she brings so much kindness and support to our group!</p>

        <p class="hidden">What I really appreciate about Vien is that we have so much in common, which makes our friendship even stronger. We both strive to do well academically, and it's cool how we can push each other to keep improving. I love that we can study together, bounce ideas off each other, and celebrate our achievements. Regularly getting those good grades feels even more rewarding with her by my side! Plus, she knows how to stay responsible while still being a little silly, which is the perfect balance.</p>
        <p class="hidden">Even though we have our serious moments, I love how Vien isn't afraid to embrace the more questionable sides of life. Whether it's a cringe-worthy challenge or the latest weird trend, she dives in headfirst, making things way more fun. As my "burgis" friend, she adds a unique twist to our adventures, and I wouldn’t trade our laughs and shared quirks for anything. We really are two peas in a pod, and I feel lucky to have someone as amazing as Vien in my life!</p>

Plus, her sense of humor sneaks up on you—she can drop a hilarious comment at just the right moment that makes us all laugh.</p>
        <p class="hidden">What’s really cool is that Jianne and I share a lot of the same interests, especially when it comes to K-pop and music. It’s awesome to have someone to fangirl with over our favorite groups and songs! Even though she doesn’t always speak up, we have really great conversations about the stuff we love, and she always has insightful things to say. It’s clear that she’s really smart and responsible, which is just another reason why I admire her so much. We both work hard to achieve our academic goals, and it's inspiring to see how committed she is.</p>
        <p class="hidden">We always joke around that Jianne’s parents are like our parents too, even though we’ve never actually met them! It just feels like she has that kind of vibe that makes everyone feel included and cared for. Whether we're sharing laughs or just hanging out quietly, Jianne brings so much warmth to our group. I’m really grateful to have her as a friend, and I can’t imagine our friend circle without her</p>
